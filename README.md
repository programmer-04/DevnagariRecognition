# Devnagari Character Recognition

An experimental FastAI vision project I created to classify/identify Devnagari characters.

Scored higher accuracy than its original paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7400041). The original dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Devanagari+Handwritten+Character+Dataset).

The model is created in `Model.py`, and optimized later in `Optimization.ipynb`. 

Based on FastAI v1.
